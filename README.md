## DEPLOYING THE APP on Netlify

#### Create a Netlify account
If you don't have one already, you'll need to create a Netlify account. Go to https://app.netlify.com/signup to sign up.

#### Create a new site
Once you've signed up, create a new site by clicking the "New site from Git" button on your Netlify dashboard.

#### Connect your repository
Select the Git provider where your Node.js app's code is stored (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), and connect your repository to Netlify.

#### Configure build settings
In the build settings, specify the build command that Netlify should run to build your Node.js app. Typically, this command is something like npm run build.

#### Configure deployment settings
Netlify allows you to configure various deployment settings, such as the branch to deploy from, the environment variables to use, and the build directory to deploy. Make sure these settings are configured correctly for your Node.js app.

#### Deploy your app
Once you've configured all the settings, click the "Deploy site" button on your Netlify dashboard. Netlify will then build your app and deploy it to a live URL.
